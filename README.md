Dummy Ruby
=========

Dummy Ruby is a ruby dummy text printer written to programmatically produce dummy text from public domain works. It is stable and is available for release.

It is a fun project intended to replace old age lorem ipsum dummy text. 

The function will rely on a number of text files in which public domain books will be stored. You will also be able to add more files to that repository of txt files.
If you want to add offline version files to the repository, you can do so by downloading files from Project Gutenberg.
